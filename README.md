# All-Occasion Cards <!-- omit in toc -->

> Generating all-occasion cards for my twitter followers with tensorflow.

ðŸ—£ Say hello! [@telepathics](https://twitter.com/telepathics)

Currently, you can only generate Valentines day cards, but I will be adding/updating designs as the year progresses and I come up with new ideas :)

## Installation

Personally, I prefer to use a [Conda](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/anaconda) env for keeping my python packages tidy, so feel free to check that out.  This is good to keep track of what packages are actually necessary.

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Otherwise, feel free to install the requirements via pip.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will also need to install enchant's C library for the dictionary, [libenchant](https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html).

*And finally, I would highly advise not using a new macbook with M1 with this project.  Just trust me.*

`python ./main.py`

## Contributing
Please feel free to fork + make pull requests with your own card designs, bug fixes, features, and whatever you think would improve this project!
