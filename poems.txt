roses are red
violets are blue
sugar is sweet
and so are you

i am collecting valentines,
some red, some green, some blue,
some big, some small, all very fine
and i am going to give them all to you.

valentine dear, i want you true.
praying cupid will get his bow,
pull back his arrow, aim it at you
so love for me you will know.

your love is so pure,
whitest of whites.
teddy bear's fur
and cleanest of nights.
for you i will wait
to grow up mature.
an innocent date
love and nurture.
until you are ready
for my love for you.
i will be steady,
a friend so true.

it is all hearts day
with flowers all around.
please tell me, just say
you will always be 'round.

hold my hand as i sway.
look into my eyes and truly say
'i will be with you this valentines day'.
and when the sun comes up tomorrow
i will be with you, so never feel sorrow
let's celebrate the now as time is on borrow

will you be my valentine?
will you be fully mine?
all the way,
every day?

all hearts day is good.
even better if you would
be my steady date
and forever soul mate.

for every valentines day
i want you to be mine.
for every spring day
i want you to be mine.
for every summer day
i want you to be mine.
for every thanksgiving day
i want you to be mine.
for every winter day
i want you to be mine.
for every christmas day
i want you to be mine.
for every new years day
i want you to be mine.
for each and every day
i want you to be mine.

i will spend valentines day with you,
nothing else will do.
valentines day is your day.
i will do everything you say.
be my valentine, honey.
i will give you me ... and my money!

i know it's valentines day
and there is the girl i love,
my shoulders are heavy weigh
and i just can't seem to say
anything well-thought-of.

i know it's valentines day
and there is the man i love.
but i am nervous, oh dear pray,
please let me be able to say
something romantic hereinabove.

how will these two ever
get over it and get together?
it saddens my heart
to see them apart.
their love unrequited forever.

valentines day is torture this time
you're no longer here, no longer mine.
i lost you somehow, you set yourself free
ran to others arms, threw away love's key.

i saw a brawny strong guy.
he definitely caught my eye.
since it's valentines day
i can't resist but to say
to him that he must be mine.

valentines day has an effect you see.
fuelling the passion of the birds and bees.
hearts want to bud, love wants to bloom,
the nectar of life, so sweet the perfume.

i want to make my own valentine
so it will be original, totally mine.
i got all exhilarated
and became creative
and made the most beautiful valentine.

valentine kisses
for my misses.

to see you
is to love you.

you have my heart,
so don't tear it apart.

valentines day is a treasure.
i will love you forever.

as fish are to the sea
so you are to me.

i am proud for them to see
that you are lovely, and with me.

i received a secret valentine.
who sent it? and is it true?
someone does love me this time,
but who is it? is it you?

valentines day can be a sneak.
it can tip toe up to your heart
and take a sneaky peak.
will valentines day find room for me
to plant my love in your heart?
if so, very grateful i will be.

your mouth is like a water lily
ready to open to me.
your waist is like soft ivory
wanting a touch, so free.
your beauty takes me somewhere else.
my love is drawn to you.
i want to bring you to my house
and become one from two.
then all the earth will fly away.
nothing else will exist
except the two of us as one.
all the earth is love kissed.

i went to my school today
and gave my valentines away,
but much to my surprise
i couldn't even surmise.
i received back more than i gave away!

i gave my teacher a red heart,
hoping she would set me apart
from all the other kids
so i would get a head start.

be my valentine at school.
that would be really cool.

i met a man named raymond.
his home is in grand caiman.
he had a bold tan,
a great gorgeous man
i made him mine, this raymond.

there is such sweetness in thy face
what can the meaning be?
i love my love because i know
my love loves me

if you'll only come and be
just a valentine to me,
cupid then will help us be
sweethearts till eternity.

i might not be your valentine.
but you can bet your life you're mine.

to be a purple pansy
may not suit your girlish fancy.
but a certain fellow with feelings fine
fancies you for his valentine.

will you be my lily putt?
'what is that', you say.
come closer, i will show you, but
you'll be mine on valentines day.

cupid got high,
high as the sky.
shot himself with his arrow,
now he is a loving fellow.

i want to catch you fast
so you can't get away.
you are so charming
and very disarming.
so you i cannot grasp.

you are a spooky valentine,
purple hair, drinking wine,
talking bad all the time.

here is a rose
sniff it with you nose
to wake you from your doze
... you see,
when i saw you, i froze
it was you that i chose
oh forgive me, my silly prose
just want you to know
when i'm hit with your glow
my legs turn to dough
i promise you though
if you'll let me, i'll show
you the best valentine's day, you'll ever know

for valentines day i will give you roses
to put between your sweet little toeses
and put chocolate, strawberries and cream candies
into your cute warm little handies.

hearts and chocolates and cameos,
i want to stuff them up your nose.
not even wanting my embrace.
just goes to show you have bad taste.

chocolates for my kitten-girl, still.
she can't eat them, so i will.

the mole found a valentines heart.
he ate it, swallowed it and tore it apart.
then his tummy hurt
and he lay in the dirt.
now that mole was not very smart.

i went to the gym one day
and i decided to stay.
there was a wee bonnie lass.
she was totally first class.
i found a good one that day!

she is a saucy little lassie,
but her mouth is much too sassy.
i must spank her behind
before i take her for mine
and give her my name, make her classy.

may this bow of white
which gives delight
and which i send you
a token be of love devine
oh, will't thou be
my valentine

dear little bo peep, my love, pray keep
don't look sad and forlorn,
you'll find your sheep,
near the hillside steep,
when bon blue blows his horn.

paeonia
symbol of happiness
wilt sublime
thou be my valentine?

as long as you're my valentine
in love's sweet prison i won't pine.

no heart there is as true as mine
to you, my own, dear valentine,
i would twine dainty garlands sweet,
our hearts to join, our love to meet

o' war is very dreadful.
there is no doubt about it;
but i shall fight to win your heart -
i can not live without it.

i scorn you love in a cottage
they're all out of style you know
but since i'm in love with you awfully
we'll have it in a bungalow

either rain or shine
or any other weather
would suit me fine,
if we could be together

in summer or winter
no matter the weather.
heart to heart dear one
we'll e'er cling together.

i want to send a valentine
a pretty one to you
but it takes a lot of courage
such a bold, bold thing to do.

our hearts are light,
they sail with ease.
side by side
in love's fair breeze.

hello-hello darling mine
will you be my valentine?

only a kiss, but in it lies
the fate of fond hearts twain,
it brings them into paradise
it fires their heart and brain.

on valentine's day, i think about
the people who are dear,
how much they add to life's delight
whenever they are near.

you've always been a total joy,
such pleasant company,
i very much appreciate
our compatibility!

on valentine's day we think of those
who make our lives worthwhile,
those gracious, friendly people who
we think of with a smile.

i am fortunate to know you,
that's why i want to say,
to a rare and special person:
happy valentine's day!

on valentine’s day, you’re on my mind;
you’re a special person, one of a kind.
you’re a pick-me-up, a happiness parfait,
so i wish you joy on valentine’s day.

valentine treasures are people who
have often crossed your mind,
family, friends and others, too,
who in your life have shined
the warmth of love or a spark of light
that makes you remember them;
no matter how long since you've actually met,
each one is a luminous gem,
who gleams and glows in your memory,
bringing special pleasures,
and that's why this valentine comes to you:
you're one of those sparkling treasures!

valentine's day reminds me
of the smile i smile
every time i think of you,
the emotional lift i feel
at the sound of your name.

valentine's day reminds me
of the strength and comfort i get
from knowing
there are people like you in my life.

everything good about valentine's day
reminds me of you.

happy valentine's day!

on valentine's day,
i think of people
who make life better,
happier, just by being around,
people whose good nature,
ready smile and eagerness to help
enrich everyone they meet.

on valentine's day,
i remember
what a pleasure it is to know you.

you're in my thoughts and in my heart
wherever i may go;
on valentine's day, i'd like to say
i care more than you know.

on valentine's day, we think of people
who have cheered and encouraged us,
who go out of their way
to be kind and caring,
who have enriched our lives
just by being themselves.
you are such a person.
i'm so happy you're my friend
happy valentine's day!

valentine's day is for expressing affection;
fond thoughts are coming your way;
we've always had a special connection,
so happy valentine's day!

hey you--
you're often on my mind;
you're a terrific person,
one of a kind.

i'm sending this poem
because i want to say
i'm thinking of you
on valentine's day!

if valentines day did not exist,
no flowers, gifts or cards,
we'd search to find another way
to send you our regards.

we must communicate to you
appreciation and respect,
hoping our heartfelt message
has a warm and good effect.

but valentine's day is here again,
so we send this poem to say:
you're extraordinary, special, rare;
happy valentine's day!

whenever likable people cross my mind,
i always have such pleasant thoughts of you.
you bring me so much happiness and joy;
those who lift me up are very few.

on valentine's day i want to tell you this:
knowing you is an extraordinary pleasure;
your caring heart is always quick to give;
you're unique, a rare and very special treasure.

on valentine's day,
i'm thinking about
the special ways
you have made my life better,
the little things,
the not-so-little things...
your kindness,
the way you always listen
and pay attention to me.
you make my world
brighter and richer.
you're a gift to me,
and i thank you
for being you.

on valentine's day we think about
those matchless people who
give extra meaning to our lives--
the very special few.

without them, skies would turn to gray;
things wouldn't be the same;
life wouldn't be as colorful;
it would be a duller game.

and when i contemplate that group--
friends and family who are mine,
i appreciate and treasure you;
you're essential, valentine!

valentine's day gives me a reason
to express the feelings
i think about but don't say
about people who enrich my life
in unique and meaningful ways.
you are this kind of special person.
when i think of you,
my thoughts are warm, and fond,
and filled with admiration.
i feel blessed to know you.
may your valentine's day
be filled with the love and respect you deserve.

valentine's day prompts me
to express what i often think
but don't say out loud:
i admire you;
i respect you;
i'm happy to know you.

happy valentine's day!

once a year is not enough.
i need every day
to tell you, special valentine,
all i want to say.

you're smart, you're kind,
you're full of fun.
you're all of that and more.
i'm so glad you're in my life.
you make my spirits soar!

roses are red; daisies are white;
valentine, you make every day a delight.
violets are blue; daffodils are yellow;
valentine, you make my heart jiggle like jello!

on valentine's day,
when i think of the people
i care about and value,
you are at the top of the list.
like a rainbow
glistening through the rain,
like a glowing green spring
after a cold gray winter,
you are a joy and a delight.
like a good book, a cozy fire,
or a cup of cocoa (with marshmallows),
you are a comfort to me.
i appreciate you.
happy valentine's day!

special people are on my mind
each year on valentine's day,
the exceptional ones who mean to me
more than i can say.

i respect you and admire you,
and i just want you to know
you've made a difference in my life
and i want to tell you so.

on valentine's day i think about
people far and near,
the ones whose special vibes create
a happier atmosphere.

for all the pleasant feelings and
the pleasant thoughts i owe you,
i want to say, on valentine's day,
i'm very glad i know you!

on valentine's day, the day of affection,
our thoughts quickly turn in your direction.
this valentine poem is meant to show you
how very glad we are to know you!

valentine, you are a gem;
you fill my life with joy and pleasure;
with all you give and all you do,
you're a very special treasure.

i really like the person you are;
you're a class act, in every way;
i care about you, and i hope you have
a very happy valentine's day!

i love you all through february,
not just on valentine's day;
i cherish you when flowers of spring
appear in the midst of may.

i adore you in the summer,
when the air is filled with heat;
without you in my life each day,
i wouldn't be complete.

i treasure you in fall,
when leaves are turning gold;
i loved you when you were younger;
i'll love you when you're old.

i prize you in the winter,
when colder days are here;
i love you, love you all the time,
every minute of the year.

so i'll give to you this valentine,
but i want to let you know,
it's not just today, but always,
that i will love you so.

valentine's day is all about
special feelings warm and fond,
and friend, i knew right from the start
we had a very special bond.

our time together is a gift;
you're interesting and warm and fun!
and when i need to talk and share,
i think of you, friend; you're the one.

we're always true and real together.
we have no reason to pretend.
i'm thankful that you're in my life,
my trusted, cherished valentine friend.

from the moment we talked, i started to get
feelings of hunger that couldn't be met,
like feelings that come when i see yummy pies,
well, i get those feelings when i look in your eyes.

the thought of your lips makes my mouth start to water,
'cause they remind me of barbecue more than they oughter.
your skin, your hair, and the rest of you brings
thoughts of chocolate chip cookies and other good things.

when you're near you provide scrumptious food for my soul.
you nourish me, sweetheart; you make me whole.
keep me satisfied, stay close or i'll pine.
i sure get hungry thinking of you, valentine!

be mine, and let's nourish each other!

i hope your valentine's day is great.
i hope it's quite a treat.
i hope you have a happy day
filled with things so sweet.

this poem's for you because i care.
i can't get more specific.
well, yes i can, and here i go…
i think you're terrific!

on valentine's day, the day of affection,
my thoughts naturally turn in your direction.
i think of many things, big and small
that you've given to me and given your all.
you see me always in the kindest light;
you're a glow in my life, golden and bright.
i'm thankful for the happy ties that bind
me to you in our family, and i'd like to remind
you of all the special memories i treasure.
having you in my life is nothing but pleasure!
you're a walking example of how to live,
how to share, how to teach, how to love, how to give.

please accept this valentine poem,
warm from the heart of your friend

every day i come to school;
i spend a lot of time
learning all the things you teach,
which is the reason i'm
sending you this valentine;
it's meant to let you know
i'm happy you're my teacher
and i want to tell you so!

happy valentine's day
to my favorite teacher!

valentine's day is a day of love,
for showing that we care,
and if we read the bible,
god describes love there:

if we speak like celestial angels
from heaven up above,
all our words mean nothing
if we don't have christian love.

love is patient, love is kind;
it doesn't brag or boast;
love conquers pride and envy;
it is never self-engrossed.

love is not rude or angry;
forgiveness counters wrong;
love stays away from evil;
it sings a truthful song.

love is full of trust and hope;
it always perseveres;
love never fails; it's faithful;
to the bible it adheres.

and if you give this kind of love
to your special valentine,
you'll be loving right in harmony
with god's own sweet design.

life is always better when
you know a person who
is congenial, compatible,
who always has a clue;

in whom the finest qualities
agreeably combine,
someone nice to have around;
that's you, valentine!

if every day were valentine's day,
then every day i'd tell you
i wish there were someone for everyone
to lighten burdens, generate smiles,
and make life a happier place,
as you do for me.
what a wonderful world that would be.

on valentine's day,
i'm thinking of you,
how i feel uplifted
whenever i see you.
your blithe and buoyant spirit
enriches every minute i'm with you.
thank you for being you.

a valentine is a person who
is often on your mind,
a shiny, special someone who
is very hard to find.

a soulmate, unique and rare, with whom
your heart and mind entwine;
so i ask you, rare and special one,
please be my valentine!

it's hard to put in words
the feelings that i feel;
the fond affection i have for you
is warm and good and real.

you're very important to me,
more special than i can say.
i'm really glad you're in my life;
happy valentine's day!

i'd have the right valentine,
if i were inclined,
someone with whom
head and heart were aligned.
finding that person is so hard to do,
that is, it was, until i met you.

a valentine is a special person,
someone who enriches your life
just by being herself.
a valentine is a ray of bright light
when the world turns dark.
a valentine is grounded,
centered, peaceful,
a role model.
my valentine is you.

i'm sending to you
a verbal bouquet;
my love to you all;
happy valentines day!

family to family, we're glad you're our friends;
our family and yours--everything blends.
our closeness provides a safe harbor in storm,
a wonderful feeling, satisfying and warm.

we wish you the best on this valentine's day.
we're sending good thoughts--an affection bouquet.
special friendship like yours is really a find
we think your great family is one of a kind.

sometimes a group of people
will bring you happiness
in ways you never dreamed of,
in ways you can’t express.

your family is like that;
that’s why we want to say
how much we appreciate you;
happy valentine’s day!

a friend is like a valentine,
heartwarming, bringing pleasure,
connected to good feelings,
with memories to treasure.

seeing a special valentine
brings happiness to stay,
and that is what you do, friend,
you brighten every day!

valentine’s day reminds me
how meaningful my feelings are for you.
you have a special place in my world
that no one else could fill.
out of your overflowing heart,
you add color and light to my life.
you continually cross my mind,
like a precious dose of sunshine,
lighting me up inside--
as i think of you
and the lasting memories
we have created together.
no valentine gift
is as precious to me
as you are,
my valentine friend.

valentine, i feel so good
each time that we're together.
we're similar souls in harmony,
birds of a kindred feather.

our hearts sing to the same sweet tune;
our compatible minds align;
could you, would you, pretty please,
be my valentine?

people come and people go,
in and out of your life and so,
when one shines bright among the rest,
and is there when needed, you’re truly blessed.
that is how i see you, friend of mine,
and why i’m sending this valentine.

a valentine friend is someone you choose
to share your life with you,
someone who is always there,
whether you’re happy or blue.

with a valentine friend, you can be yourself
you don’t need to pretend;
when you’re careful to choose a compatible match,
you create a perfect blend.

with you for my special valentine friend,
my life is full and bright;
you bring contentment, joy and peace;
you’re my valentine delight!

valentine’s day is full of paper hearts,
but my heart for you, my friend,
is full of feelings
more precious to me than gold,
as long lasting as diamonds.
my heart for you, my friend
is filled with emotions strong as platinum,
and appreciation for you
worth more to me than any treasure.
my valentine heart is yours,
my priceless friend.
happy valentine’s day!

you've brought so much joy and happiness,
i care for you more than i can express.
because you're a good friend in every way,
i'm sending my love on valentine's day.

thoughts of affection fill my mind
when valentine’s day is near;
i think about my closest friends,
those who are most dear.

and on that special valentine list,
you’re at the top, my friend.
i love you, and i know for sure,
our friendship will never end!

if i could create the perfect friend,
one of my own design,
a friend to be my companion,
a friend for a valentine,

i’d build her with a giving heart
filled with kindness, too,
a friend who’s also lots of fun,
but i've already got one--you!

a friend is like a valentine
she has a loving heart.
you share with her your feelings;
her listening is an art.

a friend is like a valentine;
like candy, she is sweet.
and that description fits you, friend;
you make my life complete!

what can i say to let you know
that your friendship means everything to me.
how can i make you aware
that my life is so much better and happier
because you’re in it.
what can i do to convey how i feel—
that i’m blessed in so many ways
to have you as my friend.
will this little rhyme help?

you’ve always been a friend so fine;
will you be my valentine?

happy valentines day friend!

on valentine's day, i think of you,
how you've set me free;
your love, support and caring
brings out the best in me.

sometimes why you put up with me
i cannot comprehend;
you give a whole new meaning to
the concept of a "friend."

you help me stretch my boundaries,
find out what i can do;
that's why my favorite valentine
will always be just you.

on valentine's day, i think of you
with pleasure and delight;
you always know just what to do
to fill my life with light.

you lift me to my highest peak,
with kindness, warmth and care.
i'm filled with peace each time you speak,
just knowing you are there.

that is why, my valentine,
i'm sending this today,
to let you know i treasure you
more than i can say.

you’ll never know what you mean to me,
and how important you’ve come to be.
we share special days as our lives entwine,
and that’s why i send you this valentine.

on valentine's day, the day of affection,
i'm sending fond thoughts in your direction.
you're really special, my perfect friend;
together, we are a perfect blend.

you give my life a special shine;
will you be my best friend valentine?

this valentine is meant to let you know
how much you mean to me, my best friend,
but there aren’t words
warm enough, fond enough,
or deep enough to express my feelings.
you are an essental piece of my life’s puzzle.
you clarify me, enrich me,
energize me, comfort me.
"fun" would be just another word without you.
as the days of our lives go by,
i fervently hope that i can bring to you
the abundant joy you have brought to me.
happy valentine’s day!

dear lord, i pray
that you will lift my friend up
with your holy, heavenly power.
support her, encourage her, i pray,
and shelter her
from all harm, evil and danger
in your safe, loving arms.
on this valentine's day,
give her a heart full of peace,
serenity and happiness.
in jesus' name i pray; amen.

thank you, friend, for all the things
that mean so much to me--
for concern and understanding
you give abundantly.

thanks for listening with your heart;
for cheering me when i'm blue;
for bringing out the best in me;
and just for being you.

thanks for in-depth conversation
that stimulates my brain;
for silly times we laugh out loud;
for things i can't explain.

for looking past my flaws and faults;
for all the time you spend;
for all the kind things that you do,
thank you; thank you, friend.

you magnify my happiness
when i am feeling glad;
you help to heal my injured heart
whenever i am sad.

you’re such a pleasure in my life;
i hope that you can see
how meaningful your friendship is;
you’re a total joy to me.

you are wonderful, one of a kind,
uniquely valuable!
right now, think of your positive qualities,
and things you can do better
than the average person can.

always remember:
your are smarter,
more capable,
and more significant
than you think you are.

someone to lean on when problems appear,
someone on whom you’d depend,
someone who’ll lift you when you’re down in the dumps,
that someone is truly a friend.

that’s how i feel about you my dear friend;
you’re so special just as you are.
just to know that you’re there provides comfort to spare;
a friendship like yours sets the bar.

because you are my friend,
my life is enriched in a myriad of ways.
like a cool breeze on a sweltering day,
like a ray of sunshine parting glowering clouds,
you lift me up.
in good times, we soar,
like weightless balloons
over neon rainbows.
in bad times, you are soothing balm
for my pummeled soul.
i learn so much from you;
you help me see old things in new ways.
i wonder if you are aware
of the bright seeds you are sowing in me.
i'm a better person for knowing you,
so that everyone i interact with
is touched by your good effect on me.
you relax me, refresh me, renew me.
your bounteous heart envelops me
in joy and love and peace.
may your life be filled
with dazzling blessings,
just as i am blessed
by being your friend.

when troubles come a callin’
as those gremlins often do,
and my spirit keeps on fallin’
till i feel low down and blue…

when i look around for comfort,
someone quickly jumps to mind,
one who always will support me,
and whose words are always kind.

who will make my mood feel lighter,
who’ll help beat my troubles back,
he/she makes the sun shine brighter
and gets my spirit back on track.

who helps the road seem straighter,
and helps me get around each bend,
who makes each day seem greater,
and that someone is you, my friend.

treasured friend, i’m glad i found you;
our friendship is a gift we share.
i can be myself around you,
safe in your love and care.

i miss you when you’re out of sight;
our friendship bond was meant to be.
i think of you with great delight;
you’re almost part of me.

through fun and fears, play and tears,
we help each other heal and grow.
i prize our time--the days, the years,
more than you can know.

just harmony for me and you,
the two of us--a perfect blend.
i’ll cherish you my whole life through,
my dear and treasured friend.

a friend is someone always there
in the back of your mind,
providing feelings of comfort and security.
a friend is someone
who adds happy sparkle to your life,
joy, fun, a predictable creator of happiness.
a friend is a stormproof shelter
from life’s challenges, troubles, uncertainties,
an unassailable bond overcoming any challenge,
strengthening the connection in the process.
you are all this and more, my friend.
thank you.

a friend is like a forest,
or a lovely, calm blue sea,
a refuge from life’s problems,
as only a friend can be.

a friend is like a song,
soothing to the brain,
distracting us from trouble,
neutralizing pain.

a friend is like some ice cream
on a sweltering summer day,
making life delicious,
in a friend’s own special way.

a friend is like a blanket,
bringing peace and rest,
a cocoon of warmth and pleasure;
when we are tired or stressed.

a friend is a bit of everything
that makes life good and sweet,
and you, my friend, are all that;
you make my life complete!

my best friend would be
someone with whom i can share
ideas, laughs, troubles, fun,
my innermost thoughts,
things i tell no one else,
someone who listens
and really cares.
that is why
my best friend is you.

you are a shelter
from life’s frequent storm;
like a comfortable blanket;
you keep me snug, safe and warm.

you’re a light in the window
when everything’s dark;
you’re a trip to the circus,
a romp in the park.

like a bright, sunny summer,
you are joy without end;
and i’m so very privileged
to call you my friend.

whenever my life feels empty,
those times when i feel a lack,
i thank god for your special friendship,
because i know you've got my back.

when i wonder about life's true meaning,
and whether it all makes sense,
with a word or a smile from you, friend,
i forget my silly laments.

i guess what i'm trying to say, friend,
is with all your support and your giving,
you brighten each minute i'm with you,
and make every day well worth living.

whether the day is good or bad,
whether i'm feeling happy or sad,
if i have a need, you’ll comprehend;
you’ll be there to share and be a friend.

other people may fill my day,
but never in such an important way;
we support each other ‘round all life’s bends,
it feels so good that we are friends.

it's such a pleasure and a joy
to have a friend like you.
you always care, you're always there,
you say the right things, too!

you make me smile when i am low
you're just a pure delight.
we talk a lot about everything;
you make my life so bright!

i hope that i am giving you
some joy and happiness,
because you mean so much to me,
more than i can express!

we share so much of our lives
our joy and also our pain.
without you as my friend,
i just might go insane!

you know what i’m talking about;
you’ve been through big things, too.
yet you cheer me when i’m happy,
you comfort me when i’m blue.

your giving does not go unnoticed;
i’d be lost without you, friend.
what we have together
no one else can comprehend.

we meet new people every day;
why we like some, who can say?
maybe it's because they think like us;
it might be because they seldom fuss.

it's hard to know why closeness grows;
we like some better; that's how it goes.
i think you're special; i’m glad we met;
let's keep having fun in our friendship duet.

everyone knows of the power of friends,
the terrific result, when everything blends.
when people have friends, they don’t stand alone;
friends always help, when you face the unknown.

friends give you courage to face problems untold,
so the love of a friend can help make you bold.
they can help you to live a much richer life,
so your every day living will be less filled with strife.

thanks for being my friend!

i always dreamed someone swell would turn up,
who’d consider my feelings routinely,
who would share lots of stuff without being gruff,
and if they disagreed would not do it meanly.

then you came along and my wishes came true;
you’re a friend who i trust and i treasure.
you always give help and i know that you care;
you’re my friend and it gives me great pleasure.

i can always look to you, my friend,
whenever life's problems abound.
it's great to know that you're there for me.
i feel good just to know you're around.

a friend is a jewel worth a fortune,
but is not just there for display.
a friend is more like a lighthouse,
when your boat has floated astray.

friend, you are really important,
so right up until life ends,
i'll value your friendship like gold.
i hope we're forever friends

lord please give my treasured friend
love and blessings without end.
bring contentment in her life;
comfort her in times of strife.

always keep her safe, secure;
let her path to you be sure.
lord, i pray my friend will be
close to you, eternally.

i’m looking for comfort food
deep in the fridge;
often i think
i could jump off a bridge.

what is the reason
for all the above?
it’s valentine’s day,
and i’m so in love!

i said to you, "oh, please be mine;
be mine forever, valentine."
i must have seemed like quite a fool,
although i thought i was being cool.

i swore that we would never part,
as i put my hand upon my heart.
had i been thinking with my head,
i probably would have fled instead.

as time goes by from year to year,
one thing is surely true, my dear;
though decades come and decades go,
just seeing you sets me aglow.

time shifts my body; i start to sag,
when i pass a mirror, it can make me gag.
my joints all ache; i can hardly move;
still a smile from you, and i’m in the groove.

getting older can be a pain,
but with you along, i can’t complain.
despite the things that we go through,
i know i’ll never stop loving you.

your loving heart turns life to play,
as we laugh at time from day to day.
so i write this poem, and i’ll hang my sign,
saying, "always be my valentine."

if i were a key, i would lock you;
if lightning, then i would shock you;
if i were a pier i would dock you;
if i had a band i would rock you.

if i were a spoon, i would feed you;
if i were a house, i would deed you;
on valentine’s day, i must plead you,
valentine, i really need you!

valentine, you’re in my dreams,
both daytime and at night;
i dream of how you’d feel to touch,
how i’d fill you with delight.

so far my dreams have not come true;
you scarcely know i’m there.
but if i were a super hero,
then i could make you care.

as spiderman i’d weave a web,
lure you and catch you in it,
so you couldn’t just smile and walk away,
after talking less than a minute.

as plastic man my parts could stretch,
i’d form them as you desire.
we could play till we got it right;
now that should light your fire.

as batman i’d show you sweet mysteries
in my secret underground lair.
i’d kiss and caress you to ecstasy;
say yes; just take my dare.

i might be the superhero you’ve dreamed;
don’t automatically deny me.
just put yourself in my loving hands;
you won’t be sorry; try me.

you’re my personal wonder woman;
be my heroine, valentine.
let me show you why you should choose me,
and why you’ll love being mine.

ince my valentine got a computer
my love life has taken a hit.
nothing i say is important
unless it’s a byte or a bit.

before she got her new laptop,
everything was just fine;
now she says we can’t talk
unless we both go online.

"but honey," i said, "i’m attached to you;
love is what i feel."
"that keyword isn’t relevant,"
she said, with eyes of steel.

she clicked the keyboard furiously;
the screen was all she could see,
and then to my horror and shame,
she started describing me:

"your motherboard needs upgrading;
your os needs help, too.
and you definitely need a big heatsink
to cool your cpu."

"don’t flame me, my sweet," i pleaded.
"not on valentine’s day."
"fix the bugs, and i’ll see," she said,
while looking at me with dismay.

"what ever you want, my darling;
whatever you need; you call it.
i’ll upload or download anything,
and then i’ll go install it."

(her hostile message keeps replaying,
and though i don’t want to fight her,
is this what i want for a valentine?
i’ve been burned; can i rewrite her?)

"are you all hard drive now," i asked
"is there no software in you?
don’t you remember the good times?
let our memories see us through."

"lol," she said to me, chuckling.
"you’re nothing but adware.
"i’ve got eight gigs of memory;
i’ve got no problem there."

"please, honey, we can save it," i said.
"our love means more than that."
"that’s not in my cache; we’re going to crash,"
she said, as she turned me down flat.

(this woman has really changed;
do i really want to chase her?
more and more i’m thinking
it might be nice to erase her.)

"aw, honey, don’t talk like that," i said.
"can’t we just plug and play?
i hereby accept default,
and i’m yours, my love, come what may.

my goal is to make you happy;
i want to be your portal,
but your sudden, distant coldness
would test the strongest mortal.

if we need a brand new interface,
so we can ftp,
i’m your go along, get along guy,
and i want you to stay with me."

"if you want to get into my favorites," she said,
and you want to get past my encryption,
if you want to get through my firewall,
here is my only prescription."

"first, put up your own web site,
and e-mail me when it’s done.
i’ll check your page rank with google,
and tell you if you’re the one."

my life has become a real trial,
since my valentine got a computer.
if i want her to care about me again,
i guess i’ll have to reboot her.

i'd do anything to make you mine.
i'd climb a tree,
swing on a vine.

i'd bungee jump,
get stung my bees,
be my valentine, oh please!

if i were a streetlamp, i'd light up the night
whenever my sweetheart--that's you--came in sight.
if i were a candle, i'd light up the room,
inhaling your body's delightful perfume.

if i were a chair where you happened to sit,
all of my senses would just throw a fit,
because where you'd touch me, you'd set me afire,
you're hot, and you burn me with love and desire.

all of my senses--sight, smell and touch
are screaming at me: "i love you so much!"
my feelings are potent, and i want you to know
the more that i know you, the stronger they grow.

i'm begging you, please, to tell me you're mine
my luscious, my perfect, my sweet valentine.

i’m an animal lover, i’m happy to say.
and i love them and pet them most every day.
so for you, valentine, i thank heaven above,
because you’re like the creatures i love.

you‘re cuddly and cute as a warm, playful kitten,
with your animal nature, my love, i am smitten.
you walk like a lioness stalking the plain,
with your dangerous eyes and your beautiful mane.

it’s such pleasure to pet you, as you sigh and you purr,
i run my hand over you, like stroking your fur.
i'm a strong alpha wolf, with you at my side,
sharing love, food and shelter, and feelings of pride.

these feelings of animal love we can share,
as i find different ways to show that i care.
so won’t you please be my own private zoo?
my valentine, i love to play with you.

i look at a tree,
and what do i see?
my valentine's face
smiling back at me.

i spot a cute rock,
but, oh what a shock,
for it reminds of you
and that is no crock.

everywhere that i turn,
my feelings just burn
with thoughts about you,
my love please don’t spurn!

each rock and each tree,
each cloud and each bee,
the earth and the sea,
it all reminds me...

i love you awesomely!

valentine, you make me silly;
you make my heart beat willy-nilly;
when i'm with you, the world is hazy;
valentine, you drive me crazy!

valentine, when we're apart,
my need for you goes off the chart.
will you be mine? can i be thine?
say you'll be my valentine!

there's a time for everything, some wise man said,
so, it’s time for this, says the voice in my head.
what happens when i say it fills me with dread,
but there’s no hiding from it, so i’ll plow straight ahead:

it’s valentines day and i love you!

now i pray this is read!

life was always quite normal and sane;
now we've met and it's weakened my brain.

my whole life now is like a story book
with a beautiful princess and villains that look
like other men, but they're evil and bad.
they keep trying to make my princess so sad
by keeping her from me. it's driving me crazy
but "happily ever after" is not for the lazy.

so i'll plan and i'll strive till my princess can see
that her handsome, courageous, hero is me.

that's what i dream;
to make my dreaming come true
the only thing needed is the presence of you
to be by my side, in the picture i see
as the princess i'll love for eternity.

for months i’ve sat and held it in,
it choked inside and hurt like sin.
it made me sweat and steam and stew,
whenever i caught sight of you.

thank goodness valentine's day has come;
if i held it longer, it would strike me dumb.
this day i’ll say it, come rain or shine...
will you be my valentine?

at first you were just a gleam in my eye,
just a squiggly feeling when you would walk by.
because you look like such a treat,
you've made mush of my brain, made me weak in the feet.

this can't go on, i've got to find out
what you are like, or without a doubt
my breathing will cease and my heart will go bust,
and all of my mechanisms will wither to dust.

i know what i'll do, i'll approach you and smile--
say, "i'm lost" or "it's a great day" or something, or i'll
pass out from fright and die of remorse.
anyway, that won't really happen, of course.

i'll just get up the nerve and say out of the blue...
"hi, my name is _____ and i'd like to get to know you."

(if you're interested, give this valentine poem back to me!)

i was strong and now i’m weak,
so a secret potion now i seek,
to help me balance out my life,
to help me shed this inner strife.

what torment makes me whimper deep,
that keeps me nights without much sleep,
that took the strength from muscles strong,
that makes me hear the birdie’s song.

this potion must be magic sweet,
to make me whole, again complete.
so be my potion, valentine,
just answer me that you'll be mine.

we're a perfect match

love is kind,
love is giving,
your love is my reason for living,
love is me and you together,
braving the storms whatever the weather,
love is warm,
love is a tender touch,
your kind words that mean so much,
love holds the key to this heart of mine,
only you can unlock it until the end of time.

on a special day like this,
my love is sent to you,
there never has been anyone in my life,
who has my heart so true,
i couldn't live without you,
you're my life, my reason to live,
you have my soul, my all, myself,
to you i freely give.

when the day is over,
and the sun has gone to bed,
i hope you think of me often,
and all the things i said,
for i'll be ever waiting,
til your heart beats next to mine,
you're my precious darling love,
my special valentine.

somewhere deep within my soul,
there lies a part of me,
that will always lie still and dormant,
just waiting to be free,
until i feel your touch,
or hear your heart beat time after time,
that still and silent part of me.
will wait 'til your heart reaches mine.

my heart aches to be where you are,
my thoughts are with you still,
i dream i'm in your arms dear,
even though i never will,
for another love she holds your heart,
i have the key no more,
but i know no matter what path i take,
you are the man i will always adore.

you are the one i have been waiting for,
you have been locked within my soul,
and now at last i've found you,
finally i now feel whole,
because part of me was missing,
but now you're by my side,
you're my anchor in the storms of life,
my mentor and my guide.

i loved you from the day,
when your blue eyes met mine,
across the room no other person,
mattered at that moment in time,
and although we can't be together,
my heart will always be yours,
you will always be my first love,
and the person i will always adore.

a special place within my heart,
is waiting just for you,
i know it will be still awhile,
before you say, 'i do',
the love that's locked within me,
is waiting to be free,
for in your life and in your heart,
is where i want to be.

we've had some bumps along life's road,
but we've always made it through,
and i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart,
as i give all my love to you,
you've made my days much brighter,
you've lifted each day with your smile,
my life would be poorer without you,
and i hope one day we'll walk down that aisle.

i am asking you to marry me
i want you to be my wife
we would live in love and harmony
together for the rest of our life

love is precious, don't loose it
love is special, hold onto it
love is all around you
love is you.

love is such a little word, yet can mean so much
love is your tender touch,
love is your sweet smile, which i haven't seen in a while
love is being with you,
love is you.

love is walking hand in hand, to a far away land
love can mend a broken heart, so we never have to part
love is knowing you
love is you.

with this note i declare my love
it's sent to you from heaven above
the day i left you i saw your tears
but i've always been there for you dear
in time we will be together again
and i'll be waiting to hold you then

i've bought the ring and want you
to say yes to me my dear
please let's get engaged today
and tie the knot next year

i see you every morning
on my way to work
i see you in the evenings sometimes
that's an extra perk

i would love to get to know you
but you never look my way
so i thought i would give this card to you
on this st. valentine's day

i'm so in love my face is aglow
all you have to do is look at me and you will know
together forever my true blue
the love feel is just for you

happy valentine's day

i've had my eye on you for a while,
and just a mere thought of you brings on a smile.
i couldn't contain my feelings and longer,
because day-by-day they keep getting stronger.
so when the opportunity came along,
i knew i just had to ask you, to...

be my valentine!!!

our eyes met, our lips touched
knew then that you were mine,
so on this day, i want you to know
i love you my darling valentine

this card i send to you today
to ask you, to be mine forever,
with our love so strong and true
we can sit, and grow old together.

my heart belongs just for you
i've loved you from the start,
since we met, my worlds complete
through life, we will never part.

you're in my heart
wherever i go,
you're in my thoughts
more than you know,
so i've sent this card
just to say,
i love you babe
happy valentines day.

i love you when you distant
i love you when you're close
and today i want you to know
you are simply the
one i love the most

i have something precious and rare,
people search but never find,
the love i have within my heart,
will be forever thine.

this valentine greeting
is from a girl, who likes to share,
your life, your love, your everything
because nothing else can compare.

to my secret valentine
hope you have a special day
one day we will be able to tell
everyone of our love
but my secret valentine
you know who i am
have a wonderful valentines day

you'll be my love for ever more.

i draw a circle, not a heart, around you
the one i love
because a heart can break
but a circle goes on forever

it takes more than lace and ribbons
and lovely verses too
to make a valentine
thats nice enough for you
it takes a world of special thoughts
tucked into every line
and thats exactly what you'll find
inside this valentine

even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
till the end of time
i love you

if i could give you the stars
i'd gather them inside my heart
i'd wrap them in love
and brighten your day
...with starlight

roses are red
pansys are pink
ive washed the dishes
so go clean the sink

how many roses should i send
to prove my love has no real end
a single rose, no maybe two
thats one for me and one for you

a dozen roses in a bow
is that a little too far to go
or should i send a couple more
ten or twenty, or a score

now should they be white or red
what was it the florest said
lets just forget the roses now
i've bought you chocolates any how

my love for you is everlasting.
happy valentine's day, my love!

you gave me your heart,
for which i hold
close to my own.

my dreams come true.

sheila m.

roses are red
violets are blue
so always remember
i love you !

roses are red and violets are blue
this valentines card is just for you.

just the sound of your name,and i flush with love.
you are the most precious gift that god has blessed me with,
knowing you love me makes my dream come true.
for i live only for the moments spent with you.

sheila m.

i can bare anything as long as you are by my side!

a true love is someone that you can bare your soul to and they still love you.

i love your lips and your eyes so bright,
i even love your cellulite.

hope that i'm first
in the queue,
when it comes to
a valentine kiss
from you!!!!

i love you more than words can say,
so happy valentine's day!

i'd shower you in roses,
but you'd probably just sneeze.
i'd buy mountains of chocolate
if i thought that it would please.
i'd buy you gold and diamond rings,
a hundred pairs of shoes,
'cause all of this is oh, so small,
compared to my love for you.

you're the beauty in the sunrise,
the soft warmth shining in the trees.
joyful lightness that's in your eyes,
the slightest tingling from the breeze.

i love you for a lifetime,
not only for a day.
i love you for who you are,
not what you do or say.

of all the things i've ever said,
of all the tears i've ever shed,
of all the things i did to you,
i want you to know that i still love you.

you are my valentine; you bring me pleasure.
with all my love you could not measure,
so on this day i shall always treasure.
happy valentine's for ever and ever.

if i could be anything in world,
i would be your tears;
conceived in your heart,
born in your eyes,

my sweetheart from now until forever.
even when death separates us,
you will always be my only true love.
i will never leave you nor hurt you.

be my valentine.
be my number one, my soulmate.
be my lover, my hero, my friend.
do not break my heart or toss it away.

it's the way you say i love you and the way you hold my hand.
there's just so much about you i completely understand.
it's the twinkle in your eye that i only see when you look at me.
it's the warmth of your hands; it sends a shock straight to my feet.

insecurity, when you walk in the room.
curiosity, when you stare me down.
speechless as can be, when you talk to me.
sparks fly when we touch, but this is reality.

the sun can burn my skin.
the beams blast from afar,
but the sun is no match to your powerful smile
that can heal a frozen heart.

your love is a gift that i treasure more with every passing day,
as time goes by, i find myself discovering more and more reasons to love you.
this valentine's day,
i'm thinking about how wonderful it is to have your love in my life.

love is when that special someone kisses you.
love is having someone to talk to.
love is being romantic on that one day.
love is happiness that is shown day after day

sugar is sweet, but you are sweeter.
chocolate is sooo good, but you are great
to be a pal, a friend, or even a date.
you are not just anybody; you are somebody

my love for you is like the raging sea,
so powerful and deep it will forever be.
through storm, wind, and heavy rain,
it will withstand every pain.

a million stars up in the sky.
one shines brighter - i can't deny.
a love so precious, a love so true,
a love that comes from me to you.

i wake up every day with your smile on my mind.
it's a beautiful sight to behold, so soft and so kind.
my dreams are filled with the thought of me and you.
i awake and smile, for my dreams have come true.

love is like a river,
a never ending stream.
love is shared by each other
to answer someone's dream.

what do i do,
when i'm still in love with you?
you walked away,
'cause you didn't want to stay.

take my heart; i'll give it with ease.
take my hand and walk this journey with me.
take these scars and heal them all up.
take these fears and make them vanish when things get tough.

love me
through it all

l is for "laughter" we had along the way.
o is for "optimism" you gave me every day.
v is for "value" of being my best friend.
e is for "eternity," a love that has no end.

you look at me as if i'm the only girl around.
you make me feel important and never let me down.

you've shown me how to live,

the thing is:
love will break you.
that is a guarantee.
yet at the same time,
it is the only thing
that can put you
back together.

a squillion stars shine in the sky.
soaring angels sing sweet songs nearby.
i wake and smile, my dreams are true.
the star in my arms, my sun, is you.

when i say i love you, please believe it's true.
when i say forever, know i'll never leave you.
when i say goodbye, promise me you won't cry,
because the day i'll be saying that will be the day i die.

beauty isn't seen by eyes.
it's felt by hearts,
recognized by souls,
in the presence of love.

there's something about
how the sea draws me in
much like your eyes
even though i know i could drown

i was never looking
for another half
to make me whole,
just someone

your heart is kind,
and my heart is truly in your hands.
from the first words we say together,
i will love you forever.

the world seems
somehow slower
when you are
next to me.

true love is measured by how deep you fall
and judged by how low you are willing to crawl
just to save it and make it last
it is determined by how willing you are to open up and offer your trust.

you bring the sunshine to my rain.
you give me love when i feel pain.

lazy mornings and starry skies,


be with someone
who fights for
you, someone who
knows you are

come a little closer
honey, come a little closer,
let me whisper in your ear.
let me tell it to you softly,

when the moon shines on your face,
i feel the warmth of the sun.
i feel your beauty beckoning me into your arms.
the soft touch of your hand on mine

in cracked skin
and calloused hands
morning light
and greying hair

you are
what i’ve been
searching for,
chasing after,

i want to live in a world
where nobody is afraid
to fall in love
or admit it

love takes time.
it takes patience
to find the one,
to find him,

you and me are one of a kind,
you and me are a perfect kind.
we can't do everything forever,
but i wish we could do everything together.

your eyes are fire.
their image burnt into my soul,
scarred by beauty.

i don’t think
she is perfect.
she is flawed and broken
like the rest of us

i can be the silence
when the world around you
gets to be too loud.

i love you with my heart.
i love you with my soul.
i know you don't believe in me,
but trust me, for i know.

if you said you were cold,
i would wrap my arms around you.
if you said you were thirsty,
i would give you the ocean blue.

how do i start?
what do i say?
i love you and you take my breath away?
do i say hold me tight, keep me warm all through the night?

if i could be anything in world,
i would be your tears;
conceived in your heart,
born in your eyes,

my sweetheart from now until forever.
even when death separates us,
you will always be my only true love.
i will never leave you nor hurt you.

love makes us strong...
then makes us weak.
love makes us see...
then makes us blind.

the sun can burn my skin.
the beams blast from afar,
but the sun is no match to your powerful smile
that can heal a frozen heart.

if roses were red and violets could be blue,
i'd take us away to a place just for two.
you'd see my true colors and all that i felt.
i'd see that you could love me and nobody else.

l, is for the laughter i give to you every day
knowing you'll never go away

o, is for the options we'll have when we're together

i love you so deeply
i love you so much
i love the sound of your voice
and the way we used to touch

the sound of your voice
calling me by what i wish to be,
ripples through the blood within me,
causing my heart to melt,

you fill the room with sweet sensation
distracting bits of information
crowd the space where logic dwells
distorting sights and sounds and smells...

my heart is something that gives me life
my heart feeds and nurtures as if it were my wife
my heart is kind and loving down to the last drop
my heart keeps me going not wanting to stop...

it feels good to be in your arms,
to feel the warmth of your touch.
i love to look into your beautiful eyes,
to see how much you care.

i want to kiss your reddish lips
i want to touch your rosy cheeks
i want to hear your lovely voice
although it can make a loud noise...

drowning my heart with his eyes,
conjuring passion that never dies,
so irresistible the pair of green,
engraved on my mind a beautiful scene,...

there is a beautiful world where i can see your face,
it exists only between time and space
time shreds space like worn out fashion,
and leaves us desperate for our precious compassion

pour the wine slowly
let it linger in the glass

lift the glass so lightly...

i know i have an angel.
she was sent from heaven above
to protect me every day
and give me lots of love

for though i hope she loves me
for she has kissed my mouth
thought i am like a stricken bird
who cannot reach the south....

love is a feeling
that you can not let go of
for it is stick...

your kiss is like a cloud,
so soft upon my cheek,
and though i never say it,
and show it in any way,...

as she stares down upon the lake
her eyes fill with tears
wondering how long she can wait
the breeze blows ever so lightly...

this passionate morning
i wake up with
your feminine body
with your seductive eyes

love is when that special someone kisses you.
love is having someone to talk to.
love is being romantic on that one day.
love is happiness that is shown day after day

i hope you enjoy valentine's day
as much as i enjoy having you as a friend.

you have a wonderful heart,
and for that reason,
i'll always be your friend.

rose petals have thorns
as their companions.
i have you.
it's good to have a friend like you
looking out for me.

you have at least
one friend
who loves having you around!

friends like you
are rare and valuable.
i don't know if
i've told you that lately.

i love having you as a friend!

having a supportive
friend like you
makes me feel special
on any day of the year,
not just on valentine's day.

thanks for being my friend
and my valentine this year!

sending warm feelings
to a great friend
this valentine's day.

i want to let you know
that i admire you
for all of your many positive qualities,
i love you despite your faults,
and i am grateful to have you as my friend.

you are my valentine's day ally.
it's nice to have a good friend like you on my team.

i just want to say thank you for being such a great friend for such a long time.
your loyalty is unfailing.

love comes in all different types.
the love of a friend is a valuable treasure.
i value our friendship and i'm grateful to have you.

valentine's day is a great day
to let those you love know
how special they are.
i want to let you know
that you are a special friend.

may you feel a wealth of love today.

i feel loved
this valentine's day
knowing that i have you as a friend.

you're my best friend and my best valentine!

i know i never have to feel alone
because i have you as a good friend.

with friends like you,
holidays become a reminder
of reasons to be grateful.

my life wouldn't be nearly as fun
without you as a part of it.
i hope you know how important you are to me.

february 14th
seems like just as good as any day
to tell you that you're an amazing friend.

all you need is love.
but a little chocolate now and then
doesn't hurt.

you, my friend,
are definitely not an angel.
you are my friend, though.
happy valentine's day.

valentine's day can be a special day
when someone really cares about you
so valentine's day is more than o.k.
since you're my friend and i'm yours too

a friend is someone you can count on
to tell you what you need to hear
a friend can give encouraging words
to help you get over your fears

friends will stay right by your side
even when others give up on you
friends can laugh when you screw up
but you'll be laughing along too

a friend is a person
to laugh and cry with,
an inspiration,
someone who lends a helping hand,
though friends may not be forever,
and they may not end up together,
the memories of a true friendship will last forever.
a friend is not a shadow nor a servant but someone who hold
a piece of a person in his heart.
someone who shares a smile,
someone who brightens up your day
what makes a person a friend?
is by saying your love will stay

we've been through so much together
in so little time we've shared
i will never forget all the moments
that you've shown me how much you cared.

the best of friends,
can change a frown,
into a smile,
when you feel down.
the best of friends,
will understand,
your little trials,
and lend a hand.
the best of friends,
will always share,
your secret dreams,
because they care.
the best of friends,
worth more than gold,
give all the love,
a heart can hold.

we are all a little weird and life's a little weird,
and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours,
we join up with them and fall in mutual weirdness and call it love.

the glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand,
nor the kindly smile nor the joy of companionship
it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when
he discovers that someone else believes in him and is
willing to trust him.

once upon a time,i fell in love with you.
and then one day we both said i do.
you are my joy and my light,
and though i'll never say it quite right,
i am yours,for always and forever.

i have a lot of love for you
i have a lot of time,
i stayed up all night long
to make this poem rhyme.
i want to make you see
that on this special day,
i give all my love to you
as it's mine to give away.

people come and people go,
in and out of ur life and so,

when one shines bright among the rest,
and is there when needed, you're truly blessed.
that is how i see you, friend of mine,
and why i'm sending this valentine.

of all the things i've ever said,
of all the tears i've ever shed,

of all the things i did to u,
i want you to know that i still love u.

of all the days we fought and cried,
of all the days i wished i'd died,

of all the things you did to pull me through,
i don't blieve it, bt i still love u.

friendship is a wondrous thing;
there's so much happiness it can bring.
i'm really glad that you're my friend,
and i hope our friendship will never end.

happy valentines day friend!

i'd build her with a giving heart.
filled with kindness, too,

a friend who's also lots of fun,
but i've already got one -- you!

i love your smile, your face, and your eyes.
damn, i'm good at telling lies!

if you won't be my valentine
i'll scream, i'll yell, i'll bite.
i'll cry aloud, i'll start to whine

if you won't be my valentine.
i'll frown and fret, i'll mope and pine, and
it will serve you right

if you won't be my valentine
i'll scream, i'll yell, i'll bite!

you're sucrose, you're glucose,
you're fructose and more,
from your head to your feet...
which are stuck to the floor.
you're hershey's, you're snickers,
you're sweet english toffee.
if you spit in my cup,
yoyou'll just sweeten my coffee.
i love you so much
that i'm getting frenetic,
but i can't even kiss you,
'cause i'm diabetic.

it's valentine's day,
and it's really quite silly;
my feelings are switching around
willy-nilly.
i'm happy, so happy!
then i'm feeling so sad;
i'm gloomy, i'm joyful
oh man, this is bad!
my body is clammy,
then i'm in a deep sweat;
sometimes i'm giddy,
sometimes i fret.
what is the reason
for all the above?
it's valentine's day,
and i'm so in love!

at last,you've found a lover
do you know what rhymes with that?
hover,cover,smother..
it's a trap,it's a trap,it's a trap.

my funny valentine
sweet comic valentine
you make me smile with my heart
your looks are laughable, un photographable
yet you're my favorite work of art

the love you give me spreads like an infection
which is why anny gave me a rejection
so let me reveal a secret to you
and then you can decide what you must do.

and on that special valentine list,
you're at the top, my friend.

i love you, and i know for sure,
our friendship will never end!

for grief, before it breaks, must reach its height,
and tides must turn before one homeward steers.
but i will watch with you until it's light.

jst as a wave is lifted by the shore,
then breaks across the slowly rising sand,

so as i watch you weep my feelings pour
across the wash of wat i understand.

but there is solace in a loving friend
and comfort in wat i don't have to say.

a friend is like a valentine
she has a loving heart.

valentine's for lovers and for friends.
all my love goes out to you this day!
love is something different from desire:
even, silent, peaceful as the sky.
nor is love interested in means or ends.
there are no selfish needs that it must weigh.
instead, love's plenitude itself inspires,
needing neither cause nor reason why.
each day my thoughts enchanted with you lie.

you are my dream, my life, my all
you are more than i ever had before
lets celebrate our love with all
lets renew our vows once more.

hold my hand and don't let go
open your heart to feel our love grow
be my valentine, my dear, be my valentine
for as along as we have living time.

my dear sweetheart, be my valentine
with all my heart i'd like you be mine,
not just today, not just a day,
but all the time, every single day.

my valentine, i love just u;
my devotion i declare.

i'll spend my life looking for ways
to show you that i care.

please say you feel the same for me;
say you'll be 4ever mine;

we'll share a life of happiness,
my treasured valentine.

but that's not all, my valentine;
my mind is also urs.
and for this fine obsession,
it seems there are no cures.

my darling valentine, it's clear,
i love you more and more each year.

our love is contentment, happiness too.
bcoz there's just no one like u.

wenever i feel down and blue,
you make me laugh, and i feel new.

ur loving looks turn my heart to goo;
there's no one, love, no one like u.

have i told u, valentine,
that i'm all wrapped up in you?

my feelings for you bring to me
a joy i never knew.

you light up everything for me;
in my heart you shine;

illuminating my whole life,
my darling valentine.

love can sometimes be fresh.
love can sometimes be new.

love can sometimes make you happy.
and sometimes make you blue.

love is the light that radiates from ur eyes.
love is ur image floating in the skies.

love is true.
and darling, the only love for me is u.

da night was made for romance.

and i knew that i finally had realized.
i want u, 4ever.
i love it when we spend every minute 2gthr.

happy valentines day.

valentine treasures are people who,
have often crossed ur mind,

love is more time to share.
it's really when you care.
it's two people joined.
i was in love with you
before you could drop a coin.

it's a sense of trust,
but not enough lust
it's a commitment to be there,
but would you always be there
to share and care?

the way you say you love me
the way you hold my hand
the way you always amaze me
that's the way our love expands

i'll kiss you and hug you
'cause you love me, too.

you help me, but sometimes,
need me to teach you to play.

so smile 'cause i love you
on this valentines day!

it's the way you say i love you and the way you hold my hand
dare's just so much about you i completely understand

it's the twinkle in ur eye that i only c when you look at me
it's the warmness of ur hands it sends a shock straight to my feet

it's how you always amaze me, you surprise me all day long
dis i know is true. baby, i'm in love with u!

my valentine, my love, my all,
how did this come to be?
this romance has me quite beguiled;
you've captivated me.

i'm sure that i was born for you;
you have me so fulfilled.
you kiss me and caress me,
as wild feelings start to build.

wid all the sunshine things you do,
da smiles you share -da laughter, 2o -

wid all the dreams you make come true...
it's great to have a kid like u!

happy valentine's day

ur love has brought me contemned, that go through to my soul.
through this peace it's given me, i can reach to any goal.

i wake up in the morning, with a smile on face.
no more dreary days, jst sunshine in its place.

i thnx the lord each night, b4 i fall asleep.
and ask him that this love, he will always let me keep.

you'll never have to worry, i'll never be untrue.
i'll love you till my dying days, my heart blongs to u.

love is the utmost feeling; love is similar to a play,
love is what i feel for u, each and everyday,

love is similar to a smile; love is similar to a song,
love is a great emotion that keeps us going strong.

i love you with my heart, my body and my soul,
i love the way i love, like a love i can't control,

kisses make the heart bat;
chocolate makes us feel complete.

hugs are a warm embrace;
lingerie is underwear with lace.

teddy bears are like mr. snuggle;
fireplaces are for huddles.

my love for you is always here,
even as i wipe my tears.

a friend is a person
to laugh and cry with,
an inspiration,
someone who lends a helping hand,
though friends may not be forever,
and they may not end up together,
the memories of a true friendship will last forever.
a friend is not a shadow nor a servant but someone who hold
a piece of a person in his heart.
someone who shares a smile,
someone who brightens up your day
what makes a person a friend?
is by saying your love will stay

we've been through so much together
in so little time we've shared
i will never forget all the moments
that you've shown me how much you cared.

the best of friends,
can change a frown,
into a smile,
when you feel down.
the best of friends,
will understand,
your little trials,
and lend a hand.
the best of friends,
will always share,
your secret dreams,
because they care.
the best of friends,
worth more than gold,
give all the love,
a heart can hold.

we've known each other for so many years,
there have been laughs and of course tears,
you cheered me up, you made me doubt,
but that's what friendship is about.
we've known each other for so long,
but that's not why we get along,
it's because all of this time,
i read your mind and you read mine.
we've known each other well for ages,
and our life is full of unread pages,
you're family to me, a sister, a brother,
and yet there's so much to discover.

i have a lot of love for you
i have a lot of time,
i stayed up all night long
to make this poem rhyme.
i want to make you see
that on this special day,
i give all my love to you
as it's mine to give away.

a friend is like a valentine.
she has a loving heart.

you share with her your feelings;
her listening is an art.

if i could create the perfect friend,
1 of my own design,

a friend to be my companion,
a friend for a valentine,

you, my love, mean more to me
than i could ever convey,
my soul mate and closest friend,
a ray of light god gave
i can't find the words to express
how much you mean to me,
for the love i have for you today
goes on through eternity.

although our love is over,it remains
an unfrequented garden in my heart,
its beauty quite inseparable from pain,
a wilderness where once was willful art.
i hope a little piece of you is still
reserved for me,a place you may not go,
but where my room, untenanted,can fill
a moment with my music,sweet and slow.
there are no wishes like a former lover's
that from the dark,repentant night must shine.
and so though we have both moved on to others,
i send you from afar this valentine.

it's valentine's day -
that time of year
when we are
once again reminded
of the grand,
old difference between
men and women.
women are better.
happy valentine's day

raindrops on our dresses,
sunshine on our face,
no matter what the weather,
the look of love won't be replaced.
the silent sound as rain falls,
the brilliance of the sun.
they only promise radiance,
caused by either one.

your beautiful eyes
your warming smile
your wonderful country accent
makes me smile

i'm shy to talk to you
foolish, i don't know why
what to be scared of,
you remind me of stars in the sky
beautiful and bright
you're a joyful sight

beautiful dreamer, out on the sea,
mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie;
over the streamlet vapors are borne,
waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,
e'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea;
then will all clouds of sorrow depart,
beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

i love thee with the passion put to use
in my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose
with my lost saints,- i love thee with the breath,
smiles, tears, of all my life!- and, if god choose,
i shall but love thee better after death.

you're the syrup on my pancakes
you're the sugar in my tea
you're the icing on my cupcakes
you're the sweets in life for me

you're the chocolate on my ice cream
you're the sweet grapes in my wine
you're everything i love in life
will you be my valentine?

will you be my valentine?
there will be no roses delivered
no chocolates that taste divine
yet none of that matters to me
will you be my valentine?
there will be no jewelry received from you
to me ~ that suits me just fine
all i want from you is your heart
will you be my valentine?

would you be my valentine?
i'll give you x's and o's
heart shaped candy
and a little rose

would you be my valentine?
and mean everything to me
i'll show you anything you'd ever wanted
be everything you need

would you be my valentine?
making all my dreams come true
cause this is your special day
i dedicate it to you.

my days are filled with yearning;
my nights are full of dreams.
i'm always thinking of you;
i'm in a trance, it seems.
you're all i ever wanted;
i wish you could be mine;
and so i have to ask you:
will you be my valentine?

be my valentine: what does that mean?
each of us mst walk through life alone,

more deeply desolate dan we have known,
yearning for a truth we've never seen.

valentines are from byond that dream,
r like a sunrise on a world of stone.

no way bt through loving might we give
da freedom of our bing to another.

in such a sacrifice we hope to live
no longer bound by dreams of flesh and bone,

when i close my eyes,
all i can see,
is just two people,
you and me.
happy valentines day honey

i love you with all my heart
right from the very start
our love grows stronger everyday
with everything you do and say
our love is here to stay.
happy valentines day

happy valentines day
for you i love
for you i hate
happy valentines day
i can't belive you
we had a date but you were two hours late
happy valentines day
when you never called i thought you got a new number
no, you were just ignoring me
happy valentines day
i think about every night in my slumber
i wish we would fall in love,its true
happy valentines day

every time i see you i get oh so weak
but i want to tell you how i feel
because every time i see you it's my heart you steal
and besides feeling weak i feel scared
because what if i tell you and for my feelings you don't care
so for now i'll admire from afar
but just know that it's you i wish for when i see a shooting star
did i mention my heart melts every time you look or come my way
but enough of that i just wanted to wish you a happy valentines day

somewhere there waited in this world of ours
for one lone soul another lonely soul
each choosing each through all the weary hours
and meeting strangely at one sudden goal.
then blend they, like green leaves with golden flowers,
into one beautiful and perfect whole;
and life's long night is ended, and the way
lies open onward to eternal day.

there's a special place
within my heart
that only you can fill.
for you had my love
right from the start
and i know you always will.
happy valentine's day

even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
till the end of time
i love you

your dreams are my dreams
your tears are my tears
and i will always love you
through the good and bad year

i love my life
because it gave me you
i love you
because you are my life

the smile that cleanses my soul
the eyes that stop time with a single glance
the touch of love from his hands
i've been waiting for this day
this special time
all i can do is pray
for you to be my valentine

where true love burns desire is love's pure flame;
it is the reflex of our earthly frame,
that takes its meaning from the nobler part,
and but translates the language of the heart.

she's all states, and all princes,i,
nothing else is.
princes do but play us; compared to this,
all honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.
thou, sun, art half as happy as we,
in that the world's contracted thus.
thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be
to warm the world, that's done in warming us.
shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;
this bed thy center is,these walls,thy sphere.

a single flow'r he sent me, since we met,
all tenderly his messenger he chose;
deep-hearted pure, with scented dew still wet
one perfect rose.

i know the language of the floweret.
my fragile leaves, it said, his heart enclose.
love long has taken for his amulet
one perfect rose.

why is it no one ever sent yet
one perfect limousine, do you suppose?
ah no, it's always just my luck to get
one perfect rose.

love is like a cloud
love is like a dream
love is one word
and everything in between
love is a fairytale come true
i found love when i found you

little loveliest lady mine,
what shall i send for your valentine?
buds are asleep and blossoms are dead,
and the snow beats down on my poor little head:
so, little loveliest lady mine,
here is my heart for your valentine.

may all your troubles be little ones
and your joys be great.
your love be true
and your life be blessed.
can i have a kiss?
from your sweet little lips.

whatever you do,
whenever you do it,
i wish you to do it twice,
and do it once for me.
for you are twice as nice
and you are twice as nice.

you are so sweet,
you make me crazy,
you are my valentine,
i love you,
i love you

i want a valentine like you,
that's why i'm so blue.
you are the one for me,
and i am the one for you.

i love you
you love me
we're a happy family
with a great big hug
and a kiss from me to you
won't you say you love me too

when you are alone
and you start to moan,
i will be right there on the spot
to ease your little mind.

i love you,
not only for what you are
