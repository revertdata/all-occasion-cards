roses are red
violets are blue
sugar is sweet
and so are you

i am collecting valentines,
some red, some green, some blue,
some big, some small, all very fine
and i am going to give them all to you.

valentine dear, i want you true.
praying cupid will get his bow,
pull back his arrow, aim it at you
so love for me you will know.

your love is so pure,
whitest of whites.
teddy bear's fur
and cleanest of nights.
for you i will wait
to grow up mature.
an innocent date
love and nurture.
until you are ready
for my love for you.
i will be steady,
a friend so true.

it is all hearts day
with flowers all around.
please tell me, just say
you will always be 'round.

hold my hand as i sway.
look into my eyes and truly say
'i will be with you this valentines day'.
and when the sun comes up tomorrow
i will be with you, so never feel sorrow
let's celebrate the now as time is on borrow

will you be my valentine?
will you be fully mine?
all the way,
every day?

all hearts day is good.
even better if you would
be my steady date
and forever soul mate.

for every valentines day
i want you to be mine.
for every spring day
i want you to be mine.
for every summer day
i want you to be mine.
for every thanksgiving day
i want you to be mine.
for every winter day
i want you to be mine.
for every christmas day
i want you to be mine.
for every new years day
i want you to be mine.
for each and every day
i want you to be mine.

i will spend valentines day with you,
nothing else will do.
valentines day is your day.
i will do everything you say.
be my valentine, honey.
i will give you me ... and my money!

i know it's valentines day
and there is the girl i love,
my shoulders are heavy weigh
and i just can't seem to say
anything well-thought-of.
i know it's valentines day
and there is the man i love.
but i am nervous, oh dear pray,
please let me be able to say
something romantic hereinabove.
how will these two ever
get over it and get together?
it saddens my heart
to see them apart.
their love unrequited forever.

valentines day is torture this time
you're no longer here, no longer mine.
i lost you somehow, you set yourself free
ran to others arms, threw away love's key.

i saw a brawny strong guy.
he definitely caught my eye.
since it's valentines day
i can't resist but to say
to him that he must be mine.

valentines day has an effect you see.
fuelling the passion of the birds and bees.
hearts want to bud, love wants to bloom,
the nectar of life, so sweet the perfume.

i want to make my own valentine
so it will be original, totally mine.
i got all exhilarated
and became creative
and made the most beautiful valentine.

valentine kisses
for my misses.

to see you
is to love you.

you have my heart,
so don't tear it apart.

valentines day is a treasure.
i will love you forever.

as fish are to the sea
so you are to me.

i am proud for them to see
that you are lovely, and with me.

i received a secret valentine.
who sent it? and is it true?
someone does love me this time,
but who is it? is it you?

valentines day can be a sneak.
it can tip toe up to your heart
and take a sneaky peak.
will valentines day find room for me
to plant my love in your heart?
if so, very grateful i will be.

your mouth is like a water lily
ready to open to me.
your waist is like soft ivory
wanting a touch, so free.
your beauty takes me somewhere else.
my love is drawn to you.
i want to bring you to my house
and become one from two.
then all the earth will fly away.
nothing else will exist
except the two of us as one.
all the earth is love kissed.

i went to my school today
and gave my valentines away,
but much to my surprise
i couldn't even surmise.
i received back more than i gave away!

i gave my teacher a red heart,
hoping she would set me apart
from all the other kids
so i would get a head start.

be my valentine at school.
that would be really cool.

i met a man named raymond.
his home is in grand caiman.
he had a bold tan,
a great gorgeous man
i made him mine, this raymond.

there is such sweetness in thy face
what can the meaning be?
i love my love because i know
my love loves me

if you'll only come and be
just a valentine to me,
cupid then will help us be
sweethearts till eternity.

i might not be your valentine.
but you can bet your life you're mine.

to be a purple pansy
may not suit your girlish fancy.
but a certain fellow with feelings fine
fancies you for his valentine.

will you be my lily putt?
'what is that', you say.
come closer, i will show you, but
you'll be mine on valentines day.

cupid got high,
high as the sky.
shot himself with his arrow,
now he is a loving fellow.

i want to catch you fast
so you can't get away.
you are so charming
and very disarming.
so you i cannot grasp.

you are a spooky valentine,
purple hair, drinking wine,
talking bad all the time.

here is a rose
sniff it with you nose
to wake you from your doze
... you see,
when i saw you, i froze
it was you that i chose
oh forgive me, my silly prose
just want you to know
when i'm hit with your glow
my legs turn to dough
i promise you though
if you'll let me, i'll show
you the best valentine's day, you'll ever know

for valentines day i will give you roses
to put between your sweet little toeses
and put chocolate, strawberries and cream candies
into your cute warm little handies.

hearts and chocolates and cameos,
i want to stuff them up your nose.
not even wanting my embrace.
just goes to show you have bad taste.

chocolates for my kitten-girl, still.
she can't eat them, so i will.

the mole found a valentines heart.
he ate it, swallowed it and tore it apart.
then his tummy hurt
and he lay in the dirt.
now that mole was not very smart.

i went to the gym one day
and i decided to stay.
there was a wee bonnie lass.
she was totally first class.
i found a good one that day!
i went to the gym one day
and i decided to stay.
there was a wee bonnie lass.
with such a nice sized 'glass'.
i found a good one that day!

she is a saucy little lassie,
but her mouth is much too sassy.
i must spank her behind
before i take her for mine
and give her my name, make her classy.

may this bow of white
which gives delight
and which i send you
a token be of love devine
oh, will't thou be
my valentine

dear little bo peep, my love, pray keep
don't look sad and forlorn,
you'll find your sheep,
near the hillside steep,
when bon blue blows his horn.

paeonia
symbol of happiness
wilt sublime
thou be my valentine?

as long as you're my valentine
in love's sweet prison i won't pine.

no heart there is as true as mine
to you, my own, dear valentine,
i would twine dainty garlands sweet,
our hearts to join, our love to meet

o' war is very dreadful.
there is no doubt about it;
but i shall fight to win your heart -
i can not live without it.

i scorn you love in a cottage
they're all out of style you know
but since i'm in love with you awfully
we'll have it in a bungalow

either rain or shine
or any other weather
would suit me fine,
if we could be together

in summer or winter
no matter the weather.
heart to heart dear one
we'll e'er cling together.

i want to send a valentine
a pretty one to you
but it takes a lot of courage
such a bold, bold thing to do.

our hearts are light,
they sail with ease.
side by side
in love's fair breeze.

hello-hello darling mine
will you be my valentine?

only a kiss, but in it lies
the fate of fond hearts twain,
it brings them into paradise
it fires their heart and brain.
